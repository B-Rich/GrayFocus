You'll need SIMBL: http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php

You'd install this by putting it in ~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins, but I don't recommend it even though this seems to sort of work. It creates insane log spew that makes the system thrash.

I'm throwing this up here in case anyone has any idea how to resolve this.
